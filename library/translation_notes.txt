final -> readonly
All "final" member variables were changed to "readonly" since TypeScript has
no "final" keyword. Readonly members can be assigned a value from the
constructor of a class, but not reassigned after that (with a few exceptions).
Note: the "const" keyword in TypeScript must be initialized when declared.

protected -> public
Protected restricts access only to subclasses in TypeScript, whereas Java
allows access from all classes in the same package.

PhysicsType2d does not use camelcase for functions, so all functions from box2d
are now (first letter) capitilized. Not realizing this causes hard-to-spot bugs
